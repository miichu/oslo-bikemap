# Bikes on map (Oslo bysykkel) project

This is a technical assignment received from Oslo Origo. The task is to make use of Oslo City bike API (https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid) to show real-time information regarding their bike placements and condition of their bike parking stations on a map. The assignment is to show a list of all bike stations, how many bikes are currently available as well as how many bikes can be parked there.

## Technologies and frameworks used

This application is written in JS with React and Typescript, bundled with Vite and can be run with a Docker image.

- 🗾 [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) has been used to display bikes on a map.
- 🐛 [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) has been used for e2e testing
- 🧠 [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview) is used for fetching and caching data. This provides us a simple way to fetch data with less boilerplate although Redux also was considered.
- 📍 [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) is used to provide better service for the user.
- 🚲 [Oslo City bike API](https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid)

### Run the Docker image

A docker image is a template to run the container. You can build this manually, then run the container afterwards. But to simplify this, we can just run `docker compose up` in the directory with the docker-compose.yml.

Everytime you make a change it will automcatically be picked up by docker whenever you run this command.

To check your Docker image, execute `docker images`
